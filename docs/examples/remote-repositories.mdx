## Overview

CPM can fetch and download projects from remote GitHub repositories, making it easy to share and distribute Claude Code projects.

## Prerequisites

For private repositories, set up authentication:

```bash
# Option 1: GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Option 2: GitHub CLI token (if using gh)
export GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Note>
You can create a personal access token at [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
</Note>

## Viewing Remote Projects

### Basic usage

```bash
# GitHub shorthand
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo

# Full URL
cpm get my-project -r https://github.com/owner/repo
```

### Output formats

```bash
# Tree view (default)
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo

# JSON output
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo --format json
```

### With specific branch

```bash
# Using tree path syntax
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo/tree/develop

# Main branch
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo/tree/main
```

## Downloading Projects

### Download to default directory

```bash
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo --download
```

Creates `./my-project/` with all dependencies resolved.

### Download to custom directory

```bash
cpm get my-project -r owner/repo -d -o ./local-copy
```

### What gets downloaded

The downloaded project is **standalone**:

- Project files (`project.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.)
- Shared components copied as actual files (not symlinks)
- Local components preserved
- No dependency on the remote mono repo

```
local-copy/
├── project.json
├── CLAUDE.md
└── .claude/
    ├── skills/
    │   ├── shared-skill/     # Copied from shared/
    │   └── local-skill/      # Copied directly
    ├── agents/
    ├── hooks/
    └── rules/
```

## URL Formats

CPM supports various URL formats:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Shorthand | `owner/repo` |
| Without https | `github.com/owner/repo` |
| Full URL | `https://github.com/owner/repo` |
| With .git | `https://github.com/owner/repo.git` |
| With branch | `owner/repo/tree/main` |
| With path | `owner/repo/tree/main/projects` |

## Use Cases

### Importing from a template repo

```bash
# View available projects
cpm get -r company/claude-templates --format json | jq '.name'

# Download a starter template
cpm get starter-project -r company/claude-templates -d -o ./my-new-project
```

### Sharing projects with team members

```bash
# Team member downloads your project
cpm get feature-x -r yourname/claude-monorepo --download

# They now have a standalone copy to work with
cd feature-x
```

### Auditing remote projects

```bash
# Check what components a project uses
cpm get some-project -r org/repo --format json | jq '{
  shared: .shared | map_values(.[].name),
  local: .local | map_values(.[].name)
}'
```

## Working with Organizations

### Public organization repos

```bash
cpm get my-project -r myorg/public-repo
```

### Private organization repos

```bash
# Ensure token has org access
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx

cpm get my-project -r myorg/private-repo
```

<Warning>
For private repos in organizations, your token needs appropriate scopes:
- `repo` for full control of private repositories
- Or fine-grained tokens with repository access
</Warning>

## Error Handling

### Authentication failures

```
Error: Authentication failed. Set GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN environment variable.
```

**Solution:** Set up a valid GitHub token with repo access.

### Repository not found

```
Error: Remote repository is not a CPM mono repo (no cpm.json found)
```

**Solution:** Ensure the repository has been initialized with `cpm init`.

### Project not found

```
Error: Project 'nonexistent' not found
```

**Solution:** Check the project name exists in the remote repo's `projects/` directory.

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions example

```yaml
name: Download CPM Project

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      project:
        description: 'Project name'
        required: true
      repo:
        description: 'Source repository'
        required: true

jobs:
  download:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install CPM
        run: pip install cpm

      - name: Download project
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          cpm get ${{ inputs.project }} \
            -r ${{ inputs.repo }} \
            --download \
            -o ./downloaded-project

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: project
          path: ./downloaded-project
```
