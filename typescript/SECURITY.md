## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at CPM. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: **security@transilience.ai**
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

## Security Best Practices

When using CPM, follow these security guidelines:

### 1. Symlink Security

CPM uses symlinks to share components. Be aware that:

- Symlinks can point to sensitive files if misconfigured
- Always verify symlink targets before trusting content
- Use `cpm sync` to regenerate symlinks from trusted sources

### 2. Dependency Security

```bash
# Regularly audit dependencies
npm audit

# Update dependencies
npm update
```

### 3. Component Security

Shared components (skills, agents, hooks, rules) are code that will be executed:

- Review all shared components before use
- Implement code review for shared component changes
- Use branch protection on your mono repo
- Audit component dependencies

### 4. File Permissions

Ensure proper file permissions:

```bash
# Recommended permissions
chmod 755 shared/          # Directories
chmod 644 shared/**/*.md   # Markdown files
chmod 644 shared/**/*.json # Config files
```

### 5. Git Security

When using CPM with Git:

- Add `.env` and credential files to `.gitignore`
- Never commit sensitive data to shared components
- Use `.gitignore` patterns generated by CPM

## Known Security Considerations

| Area | Consideration | Mitigation |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Symlinks | Can traverse directories | CPM validates symlink targets |
| Dependencies | npm packages | Regular audits |
| Hooks | Execute arbitrary code | Review all hook code |

## Security Features

CPM includes these security features:

1. **Per-directory .gitignore**: Only symlinks are ignored, not entire directories
2. **Path validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
3. **No credential storage**: Tokens must be provided via environment
